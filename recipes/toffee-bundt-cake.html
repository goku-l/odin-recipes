            of the pan.Pour remaining batter over top, then 
            sprinkle with remaining toffee bits.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted 
            in the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then invert onto a 
            serving plate and let cool for about 25 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Sift powdered sugar over the cooled cake.</li>
